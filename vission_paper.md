Short project description (1 paragraph)

Spring project  every group member implements a module („service“) and finally we put them together.
Nice to have  deploy in Docker

Main goals/functionality (epics in Scrum; table)
Birthday reminder service + Birthday wishes send service = Birthday Service
E-Mail service  Birthday + Joke
GeoData find friends service
Person management service (add, delete, relationships, change/update information)  REST 
Friends management service (add, delete, timeout/blocking, change/update information, recommendation of persons)  REST

Maybe Recommondation Service as extra, not part of friends management service 


Technical plan (which tools/frameworks)

Java for every service
Git
Apache Maven 
TravisCI   instead GitHub Actions
Spring Framework (Spring Core, Spring Data, Spring Boot,…)
JUnit
SonarQube
Docker
JMeter

Questions:
Integration Tests
Performance tests
